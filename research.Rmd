I am interested in using machine learning methods for high-dimensional biological classification problems. In  in [Raji Balasubramanian](https://raji-lab.github.io/)'s lab, I am working on classifying bacterial infections using metabolomics data. Additionally I am interested in joint estimation of graphical models and their application to correlated biological data.
